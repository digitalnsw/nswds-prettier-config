# @nswds/prettier-config

Shared Prettier config for the NSW Design System fleet — the single source of
truth for the formatting options that were previously copy-pasted into a
`.prettierrc` in every repo.

## Adopt in a repo

Install it, then reference it by name from `package.json` (delete the repo's
old `.prettierrc`):

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "prettier": "@nswds/prettier-config"
}
```

That's the whole config for a plain repo. No local `.prettierrc` needed.

## Repos that use Tailwind

The base config deliberately omits the Tailwind plugin block, because
`tailwindStylesheet` is an app-specific path (`./src/app/globals.css` in the
Next.js apps) that doesn't exist in non-app repos. Tailwind repos extend the
base in a local `.prettierrc.mjs` instead of the `package.json` key:

```js
// .prettierrc.mjs
// The package exports JSON, so the import needs a JSON import attribute.
import base from '@nswds/prettier-config' with { type: 'json' }

export default {
  ...base,
  plugins: ['prettier-plugin-organize-imports', 'prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],
  tailwindFunctions: ['clsx'],
  tailwindStylesheet: './src/app/globals.css',
}
```

## Changing the shared options

Edit `index.json` and merge to `main` — [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/)
versions and publishes it from the Conventional Commit message. Consumers pick
it up on their next `npm update` (Renovate opens the bump PRs).

Publishing uses **OIDC trusted publishing**, so there is no `NPM_TOKEN` secret in
this repo.

`index.test.mjs` resolves every option through Prettier's own support info on
each CI run. Prettier silently ignores keys it does not recognise, so without
that check a typo in `index.json` would ship and quietly stop being applied.
